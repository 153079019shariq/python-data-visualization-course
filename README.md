# Data visualization with Python course

© 2016 Randal S. Olson

In this repository, you will find course materials for teaching data visualization with Python. I'll be developing these teaching materials over time to provide a hands-on course that will take you from beginner to intermediate level of programming data visualizations.

Some of these materials are based on the video course I developed with O'Reilly called [Data Visualization Basics with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046592.do).

## Course Prerequisites

I designed this course with the expectation that you will have a basic working knowledge of Python, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). If you're unfamiliar with any of these topics, I have provided links to free online learning materials for them below.

**Python** has many excellent tutorials and books to learn from, many of which are listed in the [/r/LearnPython wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index).

**pandas** has [several tutorials](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html) covering its myriad features.

The **Jupyter Notebook** has [thorough documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) for how to install and use it.

## Table of Contents

### Section 1: Introduction

This section simply introduces the course, the presenter(s), and what to expect from the course. There are no instructional materials for this section.

### Section 2: Basics of data visualization

This section covers the basics of data visualization and design, such as choosing the right chart type for your message, good practices, and common pitfalls in data visualization. You will learn the fundamental lessons that anyone aspiring to become a great data visualization practitioner must learn.

### Section 3: Data visualization in Python - matplotlib

This section dives into coding data visualizations with Python, in particular with the [matplotlib library](http://matplotlib.org/). You will learn how to code bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and many more basic chart types.

*More sections are currently being developed, including sections on statistical visualization with [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) and interactive visualization with [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/).*
